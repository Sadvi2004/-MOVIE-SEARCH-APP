description:
As part of my React.js web development internship, I developed a Movie Search App that allows users to search for movies and fetch detailed information using a public API like OMDB. The app provides an intuitive and seamless experience for movie enthusiasts by displaying relevant details such as the title, release year, genre, ratings, and poster images. Fetches movie details dynamically from a public API (e.g., OMDB). Users can search for movies by entering keywords or titles. It allows users to mark and save their favorite movies for quick access.
